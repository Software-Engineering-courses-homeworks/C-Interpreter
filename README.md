# C-Interpreter

A small project done between 2nd and 3rd years in college

## The Interpreter

This is a bytecode interpreter implemented in C. It features:

- Toggleable NaN boxing for efficient value representation
- Support for various data types (numbers, booleans, nil, objects)
- Full OOP support
- Can receive file path arguments to run code
- Has toggleable flag for debug and GC logging

## The Language

The language implemented by this interpreter supports:

- [Describe syntax and features of your language]
- [Explain data types and operations]
- [Document control structures]

## How It Works

The interpreter processes code through the following stages:

- Lexical analysis (scanning)
- Parsing into an abstract syntax tree
- Compilation to bytecode
- Virtual machine execution

[Add more implementation details about how your interpreter processes code]

## Potential Future Additions

Future improvements could include:

- Improve performance by running the program with a profiler to find hotspots
- Add more native C functions to the language
- Create a website to host the interpreter with an interface to run the code
